To install Apache Kafka on your local Ubuntu machine, including Zookeeper, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Java

Kafka requires Java. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

You can verify the installation with:

```bash
java -version
```

### Step 2: Download Kafka

1. **Navigate to the `/tmp` directory** (or any directory where you want to download Kafka):

   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   ```

2. **Download Kafka**:

   Use `wget` to download the latest version of Kafka. You can check for the latest version on the [Apache Kafka download page](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).

   For example:

   ```bash
   wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/<version>/kafka_2.13-<version>.tgz
   ```

   Replace `<version>` with the latest version number.

3. **Extract the Downloaded Archive**:

   ```bash
   tar -xzf kafka_2.13-<version>.tgz
   ```

4. **Move to the Kafka Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd kafka_2.13-<version>
   ```

### Step 3: Start Zookeeper and Kafka

1. **Start Zookeeper**:

   You can start Zookeeper using the following command:

   ```bash
   bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
   ```

2. **Start Kafka Broker**:

   Open another terminal window (keeping Zookeeper running) and run:

   ```bash
   bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Kafka is Running

You can create a topic to check if Kafka is running:

1. **Create a Topic**:

   In a new terminal, run:

   ```bash
   bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
   ```

2. **List Topics**:

   To verify the topic was created:

   ```bash
   bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
   ```

### Step 5: Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to stop the services, you can use the following commands in the terminal where Zookeeper and Kafka are running:

- For Zookeeper:
  ```bash
  bin/zookeeper-server-stop.sh
  ```

- For Kafka:
  ```bash
  bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
  ```

### Notes

- Ensure that the commands are executed in the directory where Kafka was extracted.
- If you encounter any issues during this process, feel free to ask for further assistance!
